<p>Termites cause billions of dollars in property damages every year in the United States, eating their method through the wood of homes and organisations. Quotes on IPM adoption in some crops are given in the Tables 5, 6 and 7 These tables consist of details on direct measurement such as location under IPM or indirect measurement such as impact on reduction in pesticide use, application frequency, or treated area.

<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or a minimum of consideration for its adoption at the regional or nationwide level in the majority of nations, and in lots of it has ended up being main governmental policy.

<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the same ideas as IPM however limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
