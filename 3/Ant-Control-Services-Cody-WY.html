<p>A particular pest can be controlled by certain alternatives, but they may not all be available in a particular place, for a particular crop, or within the available financial means. IPM involves using the best mix of cultural, chemical and biological procedures for particular circumstances, consisting of plant biotechnology as appropriate.

<p>Pests can end up being a pricey issue for your business if left to their own gadgets. If more monitoring, recognitions and action thresholds show that less dangerous controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.
