By using structural and biological methods we're better able to control a wide array of pest associated issues.</p>
<p>As the trend towards bio-rational products and sustainable services continues, it will be important to ensure your pest management professional has a basic knowledge and understanding of Management in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the National Organic Program (NOP), the new (and altering) food security regulations, and where or when these types of services or materials can be integrated into IPM programs.</p>
