Greenhouses provide an appropriate environment (e.g., temperature and light) for numerous biological control agents or natural enemies consisting of parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to artificial chemicals, and have a lot of the human and ecological safety threats as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>However, for serious pest problems especially around your office, we can customise our industrial pest control services to make them much faster and more effective. There are three classifications of biopesticides. In food processing environments, quality pest control is a must.
