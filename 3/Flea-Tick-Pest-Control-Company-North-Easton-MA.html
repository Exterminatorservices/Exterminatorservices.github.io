<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least factor to consider for its adoption at the local or nationwide level in many nations, and in many it has ended up being official governmental policy.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a rich community likely will have a great deal of large, costly homes, so pest control expenses could be greater there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
