<p>They need to also be detail-oriented in handling pesticides and chemicals that are possibly damaging. Find out more about Rentokil PCI's services for typical pests in businesses and homes. The 4 major issues experienced with traditional pesticides are harmful residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a method that prevents pest damage with minimum negative impact on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, documents, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, hence causing gigantic damage within simply a couple of months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and companies to check for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes presenting natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a brand-new area where native natural opponents do not provide control.</p>
