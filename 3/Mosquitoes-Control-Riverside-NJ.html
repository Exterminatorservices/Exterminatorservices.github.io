<p>The course will focus on the environmental and management concepts of pest control and you will learn to examine the effects of pesticide usage and application on the biological target. The United States EPA Biopesticides page contains better details. Adoption of IPM can be viewed under a continuum, beginning with systems mostly confined to utilizing a single tactical method such as using financial thresholds for better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>All at once, it is also based upon semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are fended off or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). Most pesticide issues are triggered by a small number of the pesticides readily available today.</p>
<p>Using info about pests' biology and routines, in addition to an arsenal of pest management techniques, pest control employees find, determine, and get rid of pests. However due to the fact that these "sex" traps bring in mostly male insects, they aren't extremely effective controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A regular monitoring program is the basis of IPM decision making, no matter the control strategies utilized.</p>
