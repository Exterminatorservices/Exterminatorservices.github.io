When pest or illness levels are low and actions most effective, early detection of diseases and pests leads to prompt action. These pests also bring hazardous bacteria and diseases on their bodies that can be transmitted to people who enter into contact with their droppings, urine and polluted surface areas or items.</p>
<p>Termites eat furnishings, papers, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, hence triggering enormous damage within just a couple of months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and services to check for insects or rodents.
