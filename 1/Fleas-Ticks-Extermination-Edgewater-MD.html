A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>
