<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a environmentally delicate and effective approach to pest control. These may or might not consist of products noted on the Organic Products Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides utilized in natural farming and organic gardening are typically more secure than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
<p>Tracking and identification minimizes the risks of using the wrong kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other techniques will be more effective. The benefit of the fogging pest control technique is that it's considered to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are tough to be cleaned. Cultural practices - count on a method to make the crop or habitat undesirable to pests by hindering their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or place by both grownups and immatures.</p>

<p>This method refers to the use of a variety of mechanical or physical techniques for pest exemption, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
