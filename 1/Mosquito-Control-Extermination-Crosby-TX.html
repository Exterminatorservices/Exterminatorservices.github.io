<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the environment as a whole and thinks about a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>Common pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so intolerable sometimes that the only alternative left is to work with a local pest control company to get rid of pests. The technician will commonly spray pesticides around the perimeter of various rooms if an expert pest control company is under contract to an institution. Therefore, incorporated pest management implies that areawide and long-term methods can be valuable.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be really effective in causing considerable decreases in pest populations in particular circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural opponents or conserving natural opponent populations by offering sanctuaries or preventing practices that damage them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management means careful factor to consider of all available plant security approaches and subsequent combination of appropriate procedures that prevent the development of populations of hazardous organisms and keep using plant protection items and other kinds of intervention to levels that are economically and environmentally justified and decrease or minimise dangers to human health and the environment.</p>
