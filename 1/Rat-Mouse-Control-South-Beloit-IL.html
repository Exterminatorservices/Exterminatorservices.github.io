<p>Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level.

IPM involves utilizing the very best mix of cultural, biological and chemical procedures for particular situations, including plant biotechnology as suitable. This planning includes attention to field histories to expect what the pest problems might be, selecting crop ranges which are tolerant or resistant to pest damage, picking tillage systems that will suppress anticipated pest damage while providing the crop the best yield capacity.</p>

Practically every type of pest postures a danger to the properties they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
