<p>Eliminate or cover bird cages and aquarium, and transfer other animals before using aerosol (spray) pesticides. Make sure the individual who will be applying your pesticides holds a legitimate picture ID Pest Control Licence. Consumers should inform the pest exterminators about the particular infestations prior to the treatment or at the time of booking.
