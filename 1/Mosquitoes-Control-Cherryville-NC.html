<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>These unidentified or poorly comprehended prospective dangers argue for extra levels of protection including exposures to multiple pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet plan; exposure to chemicals in mix with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and individual care products; and the general problem in attributing chronic health problems to any one specific cause.</p>
