<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community technique to crop production and defense that integrates various management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize using pesticides. By completing and making use of an IPM strategy, members may have the ability to conserve cash on pest control methods which were formerly used and can potentially decrease future problems with pesticide resistance on farm.
