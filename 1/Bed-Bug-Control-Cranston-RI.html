<p>Socio-psychological elements including moral and reasonable considerations were found to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).

<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Directive on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are required to think about the concepts of IPM before using chemicals. Biological pest control is an approach of controlling pests such as insects and mites by utilizing other organisms 8 It depends on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but normally also includes an active human management function.</p>
<p>The very best method to control pests is to make your home unattractive to them. But family pests can likewise be a danger to your household. When looking for a location to infest, pests prefer to hide in a place that supplies food and a safe breeding place.

The majority of pesticide problems are brought on by a small number of the pesticides readily available today.</p>
