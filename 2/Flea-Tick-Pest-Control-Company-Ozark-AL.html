<p>Natural enemies can be efficient, and pesticides (chemical substances for controlling pests) are only used when alternative options do not produce the necessary result.

<p>Termites eat furnishings, papers, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, hence causing gigantic damage within just a few months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and businesses to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes presenting natural opponents from a pest's native range into a new area where native natural enemies do not offer control.</p>
