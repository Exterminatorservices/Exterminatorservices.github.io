<p>Although several sources specify IPM in different ways, previous models mainly focused on the ecological, and to some level on the evolutionary, aspects of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) determined an absence of a holistic IPM technique that utilizes both traditional and modern tools.</p>

Categories might consist of basic pest control, rodent control, termite control, fumigation, and turf and decorative control.</p>
