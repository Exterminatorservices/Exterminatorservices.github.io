<p>The determination of the proper cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides harmful to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect types or life phases.</p>
<p>Pesticides are chosen and applied in a way that decreases their possible damage to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misconstrued as pest management without chemicals which in fact need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or product packaging, and the facility itself will attract pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy community likely will have a great deal of big, pricey homes, so pest control costs might be higher there due to the fact that there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
