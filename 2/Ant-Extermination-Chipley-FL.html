<p>Such approaches have actually been used for a long time to tackle pest control issues within the household as well as in agricultural settings. In concept, natural opponents utilized in these methods are biopesticides, and the basic techniques vary from conventional pesticidal applications only in the kind of items utilized. Biological control - biological control in natural plant protection is an approach of controlling insect pests and illness utilizing other organisms which rely on herbivory, predation and parasitism, or some other natural systems with active farmer's management interaction.</p>
