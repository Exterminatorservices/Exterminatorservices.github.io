<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants checked. It's possible that the repeated use of pesticides might be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves.

<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is considered as a cost-effective and ecologically benign pest control method ideally matched for both little and large farmers all over the world.
