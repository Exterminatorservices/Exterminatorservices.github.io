Quotes on IPM adoption in some crops are given up the Tables 5, 6 and 7 These tables include information on direct measurement such as area under IPM or indirect measurement such as influence on reduction in pesticide usage, application frequency, or treated location. A particular pesticide may have been registered for a pest on some crops, but not on all.

<p>In contrast, natural food production uses many of the exact same principles as IPM however limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
