The following example explains the 6 components of an Integrated Pest Management program used to handle carpenter ants. Focusing generally on long-lasting pest prevention, an effective IPM program uses a combination of control approaches including biological control, environment control, changes to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>Some also recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM could happen, even annual management of a continuous pest might be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998).
