<p>Normally, the primary objective of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ).

<p>Pest control is an incredibly crucial step owing to the truth that a number of pests are providers of hazardous disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the removal of a few pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
