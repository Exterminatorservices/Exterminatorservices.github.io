To determine IPM adoption, it is required to identify the factors that identify whether a pest control program certifies as an IPM system. Pest-tolerant crops such as soybeans may not require interventions unless the pests are many or quickly increasing.</p>
<p>Based on a just recently published report by Fortune Business Insights titled, Pest Control Market Size, Share & Industry Analysis, By Pest Type (Insects, Termites, Rodents, Others), Technique (Chemical, Mechanical, and Biological), Application (Residential, Commercial, and Industrial), and Regional Forecast, 2020 - 2027," the market value was USD 19.73 billion in 2019 and is prepared for to increase at a CAGR of 6.31% during the forecast duration, 2020 to 2027.</p>

Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
