<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique is based upon our four principles that together we call ERDM. We understand that discovering pests in your home or business is distressing. Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control takes time and efforts. Pests are undesirable plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home bug pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about reducing pesticide usage.
