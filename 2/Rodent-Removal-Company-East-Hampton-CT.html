<p>Pesticides are chosen and used in a way that reduces their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the ingredients or packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
<p>A redirection of pest management is required to integrate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and neighborhood levels and to consider the effects of these practices on the general animals, dietary state, and balance of regional communities (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to explain a methodical method of handling pests utilizing non-chemical pest management methods and the sensible use of pesticides when pest populations exceed acceptable levels.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical industry to indicate virtually anything a practitioner wants it to suggest, Beyond Pesticides has welcomed the expression Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus practitioners require to have -stressing the broader ecology of pest management and avoiding harmful chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
