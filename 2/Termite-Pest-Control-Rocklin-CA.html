<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>The determination of the right cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural opponents than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
